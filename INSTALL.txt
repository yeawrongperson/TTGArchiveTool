├── screenshots/        PNG images
│   ├── extra/         Profile, wall, friends
│   ├── topics_live/   Your topics (forums)
│   ├── topics_arch/   Your topics (archives)
│   ├── posts_live/    Your posts (forums)

    ├── done_urls.json Resume progress
    └── runlog.txt     Detailed log

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Images not loading
SOLUTION: Some external images (Discord, Imgur) may be blocked or deleted.
          HTML files still contain image URLs - some may work when opened
          in browser.

PROBLEM: Cloudflare challenges
SOLUTION: 1. Wait 30-60 seconds (usually resolves automatically)
          2. Run during off-peak hours (late night/early morning)
          3. Complete the challenge manually in the browser

PROBLEM: Script hangs
SOLUTION: Click "Stop" button, then restart - progress is saved automatically

PROBLEM: Missing pages
SOLUTION: Latest version detects all pages sequentially!
          Check log for: "Detected X total pages"

PROBLEM: Window too small
SOLUTION: Resize it! Or edit the file and change:
          self.root.geometry("900x800")  # Make these numbers bigger

PROBLEM: "Ready to Continue" never enables
SOLUTION: Wait for page to fully load (~10 seconds)
          Look for "=== LOGIN TIME ===" in the log
          Button only enables AFTER that message

================================================================================
TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================================================================================

DO:
  ✓ Archive during off-peak hours (late night)
  ✓ Test with a small archive first
  ✓ Keep the browser window open
  ✓ Use the Stop button (not browser close)
  ✓ Archive NOW - don't wait!

DON'T:
  ✗ Close the browser window manually
  ✗ Run multiple instances simultaneously
  ✗ Wait until January 30th!

A PERSONAL MESSAGE
================================================================================

Hey everyone,

I apologize for getting this tool out so late - with only 3 days left until 
TTG closes. Life got in the way, work piled up, and honestly, I kept putting 
it off because I wasn't ready to accept that this place is really ending.

TTG has been a huge part of my life for years. The tech discussions, the 
troubleshooting sessions, the friendships formed. This community shaped a lot 
of us, and while the forum may be closing, the memories don't have to 
disappear.

I built this tool because I wanted to make sure nobody loses their history 
without at least having a chance to save it. It's not perfect, and I wish I'd 
released it sooner, but I hope it helps some of you preserve your TTG memories.

Please share this with anyone who might want to archive their content. We're 
running out of time.

To everyone who's been part of this community: thank you. For the help, the 
laughs, the debates, the shared knowledge.

TheTechGame: 2006 - 2026
Thank you for the memories.

— Cygnet
